		<h3>Business Plan</h3>
		<p>
			<!-- the business plan goes here -->
Executive Summary:<br>
Our company is dedicated to limit the lives risked by fire. We will do that by making firefighting robots. This robot limits the amount of human error made during life threatening moments. The robot has the tools and power to break down most walls in buildings, it also has many tools to put out fires, but due to the size of the robot, it can not carry fire extinguishers large enough to take care of big fires. The robot is shaped like an closet so people could be kept inside the robot which is heat resistant, so the person inside of the robot wouldn’t get cooked alive inside of the robot. The robot would locate the people inside the burning building, then, it would find the easiest way to them. Because our Firedboy have flying mechanics, it could enter through the roof. It’s also prepared with a parachute, so it could jump out of a burning building with a parachute just in case they don’t anyway out. 
<br>
Organizational structure:<br>
CEO: Our CEO is charge of making major decisions such as where to sell, what parts of Firedboy to upgrade, 
CTO: The CTO works with Executive Management to grow the company 
COO: The COO maintains control of diverse business operations
CMO: The CMO oversees the planning, development and execution of our organization's marketing and advertising initiatives

<br>
Long term growth:
In the long term, we aim to make more than 2060 Firedboys. That comes up to at least about $618,000,000, but if all goes well, we will make at least $1,030,000,000. That is at least $412,000,000 profit from selling Firedboys. We plan to make more factories and employ more people in the factories with the money. We also plan to make Firedboys more accessible to the average person by making them smaller and cheaper once we have reached our goal of making 2060 Firedboys. And, if we can, we will make many more Firedboys to provide more people with more Firedboys. We also aim to provide Firedboys to most to all firefighting stations in the US and around the world. If we can, we might also want to make it cheaper to make it more accessible. 
<br>
Operations: <br>
Demo in an abandoned building<br>
Getting into the field to show the possibilities<br> 
Showing all possibilities to the customers <br>
	Firedboy plans to draw customers by showing the effectiveness of our robot. To show the effectiveness of our robot we will have public demos in abandoned building where the robot puts out fires and saves dummies. While our robot can save people from burning buildings it can do everything normal firefighters can do without risking human lives.
<br>
SWOT Analysis:<br>
<br>
Strengths:<br>
Well tested robots<br>

<br>
Opportunities:<br>
Make the robot more comfortable to be in<br>
Make enough space for a doctor to help patients<br>
<br>
Weaknesses:<br>
New in the market<br>
The robot puts saving lives over fighting fires(could be good and bad)<br>
Firefighters might lose their jobs<br>
<br>
Threats:<br>
Firefighters not getting interested in product <br>
Cities not wanting to pay the full price<br>
Firefighters might get offended that robots are taking their jobs<br>
<br>
How to get rid of threats:<br>
We will make sure that the firefighters know that the product will help <br>them in their job<br>
Make the robot cheaper<br>
Make good partnerships with firefighters<br>
