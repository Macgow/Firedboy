		Our company is dedicated to limit the lives risked by fire. We will do that by making firefighting robots. This robot limits the amount of human error made during life threatening moments. The robot has the tools and power to break down most walls in buildings, it also has many tools to put out fires, but due to the size of the robot, it can not carry fire extinguishers large enough to take care of big fires. The robot is shaped like an closet so people could be kept inside the robot which is heat resistant, so the person inside of the robot wouldn’t get cooked alive inside of the robot. The robot would locate the people inside the burning building, then, it would find the easiest way to them. Because our Firedboy have flying mechanics, it could enter through the roof. It’s also prepared with a parachute, so it could jump out of a burning building with a parachute just in case they don’t anyway out.
